# clinterpreter
Command-Line Interpreter project for Grundlagen der Betriebssysteme (Operating Systems) course.

## Setup
Run `source source_mich` to export the cTools folder to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Compile `clinterpreter.java` and run it to get the command line interpreter.

Supports piping, redirecting to stout and from stdout, and providing multiple files as input.

`head.java` contains an modified version of the \*nix utility `head`. This can be run in the command-line interpreter as well.
